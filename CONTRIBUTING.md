# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  Contributions are welcome and appreciated.  To help us maintain quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Issue first.**  Before starting work, open an issue describing the bug or feature you plan to address.  This helps us discuss the approach and avoid duplicate work.
2. **Fork & Branch.**  Fork the repository and create a new branch for your work.  Use a descriptive branch name such as `feature/add-route-optimizer`.
3. **Coding standards.**  We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org) for formatting and linting.  Install pre‑commit hooks (`pre-commit install`) and ensure tests pass (`make test`) before submitting a pull request.
4. **Tests & Docs.**  When adding functionality, include unit tests in the `tests/` directory and update the documentation in the README or docstrings as needed.
5. **Pull request.**  Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.  Provide a clear description of your change and reference the issue it addresses.  One of the maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback.

We aim to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.  All interactions in issues, pull requests and other communication channels are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
